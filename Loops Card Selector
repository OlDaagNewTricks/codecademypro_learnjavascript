Codecademy Learn JavaScript "Loops" Card Selector Code

//I Like this code for some reason.  Maybe because it uses a randomizer and then a while function.  
//Then it displays the findings until the correct random card is found, and logs it to the screen.

let cards = ['Diamond', 'Spade', 'Heart', 'Club'];

//Under let currentCard one can change the variable to any of the random card types

let currentCard = 'Heart'
while (currentCard !== 'Spade') {
  console.log(currentCard)
  currentCard = 
  cards [Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)];
}

console.log('I found a spade');
